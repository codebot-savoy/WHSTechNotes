I think the new school cell phone law is helpful because it keeps students more focused during class. For example, before the rule, I saw a lot of people scrolling through TikTok or texting instead of paying attention to the teacher. Now that phones are put away, students seem more engaged in lessons and less distracted. This shows that the law can improve learning and help teachers keep control of the classroom. While it might be annoying not to check our phones all the time, the benefits of paying attention and getting better grades are worth it.

I am interested in a career in sports, and I think computer science can play a big role in it. For example, data tracking and analytics are used to study player performance, injury prevention, and even game strategies. Sports teams already use computer programs to measure speed, strength, and accuracy, which gives them an advantage. This proves that computer science is valuable because it helps athletes improve and coaches make smarter decisions. Overall, computer science makes the sports world more advanced and competitive, and I think it will only keep growing in importance.
