I think the new school cell phone law is helpful because it keeps students more focused during class. For example, before the rule, I saw a lot of people scrolling through TikTok or texting instead of paying attention to the teacher. Now that phones are put away, students seem more engaged in lessons and less distracted. This shows that the law can improve learning and help teachers keep control of the classroom. While it might be annoying not to check our phones all the time, the benefits of paying attention and getting better grades are worth it.

I am interested in a career in sports, and I think computer science can play a big role in it. For example, data tracking and analytics are used to study player performance, injury prevention, and even game strategies. Sports teams already use computer programs to measure speed, strength, and accuracy, which gives them an advantage. This proves that computer science is valuable because it helps athletes improve and coaches make smarter decisions. Overall, computer science makes the sports world more advanced and competitive, and I think it will only keep growing in importance.

My idea for an AI project is an app that helps students with mental health by checking in on their mood and giving them resources or someone to talk to. This meets the challenge requirements because it uses AI responsibly to support students, and it focuses on health and safety in the community. The AI could recognize patterns in how students are feeling and suggest ways to cope or connect them to a counselor if needed. This project would be useful because many students struggle with stress, anxiety, and depression, but not everyone asks for help. An AI tool could make it easier and less intimidating to get support. It would help people by promoting mental health awareness and giving students a safe way to manage their feelings.

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for the future of jobs. Claim: It can give people more opportunities to earn money from anywhere in the world. Evidence: For example, IKEA is opening a new store on Roblox where players can stock shelves, serve food, and help customers while getting paid real money. Reasoning: This shows that companies see the value in digital jobs and are willing to invest in them. Another reason this is a good idea is that it helps people who may not be able to work in a traditional store, like those with disabilities or people who live far away from big cities. Virtual jobs can also prepare young people to learn skills like communication, teamwork, and using technology. Overall, I believe that working in a virtual store is a smart and creative way to expand the future of work.

The phrase “6, 7” can sound mysterious, but students use it casually as a way to keep conversation moving. It might mean “everything’s fine” or “just okay” depending on tone. In the halls, it can be filler talk to avoid silence. People repeat it because it’s short, easy, and playful. It also works like an inside joke. Students like phrases that connect them quickly without much thought.

If I were in charge of my school, I would allow technology like Chromebooks and AI tools such as ChatGPT, but with some limits. Students could use AI for help with homework or studying, but not for cheating on assignments. Phones would be allowed during lunch or free time, but not in class unless needed for schoolwork. I’d keep entertainment games blocked, but allow learning games that help with math or problem-solving. These rules would help students stay focused while still using technology to learn in smarter ways. Overall, it would make school more modern and balanced.
